### About Me 🥳

My name is Chase Struse, hence the very creative username ChaseStruse. I have been a developer since 2018 and have loved (almost) every minute of it. Outside of programming I love playing basketball, video games, and pretty much doing anything nerdy. I am a huge Boston Celtics fan and can talk to you about them for hours, so feel free to hit me up anytime. 

### Knowledge 🧠

Currently I have worked professionally using: React, Angular, C# .Net, and SQL

In my free time I have used: C++, Python, and Swift

### Currently working on? 👷‍♂️

Currently I have been working on various different python projects and would love to collab with anyone who would want to!
